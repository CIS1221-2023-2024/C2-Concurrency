# Responses to Challenger

## arrayGenerator.py
Thank you for the suggestion. It is a good point to bring up that random.sample ensures the elements are unique to improve the execution time. 
However, I wish this function to better mirror real life scenarios in which duplicate values are present. 
As such, I desire to keep the current implementation of random.randint allowing for a more realistic test for the sorting algorithms.

## bubbleSortFunction.py
Iâ€™ve implemented the suggestion which has improved the time complexity to O(n) in the best-case scenario. 
This also still retains its purpose as a comparison to the concurrent merge sort algorithm to demonstrate the strengths of concurrency and more advanced sorting algorithms.
